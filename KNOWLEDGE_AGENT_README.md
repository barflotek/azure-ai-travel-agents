# Knowledge Agent - Working Implementation

## ✅ Status: FULLY WORKING

The knowledge agent is now fully functional and deployed to GitHub. It works without Docker dependencies.

## 🚀 Features

- **✅ OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5-turbo for intelligent responses
- **✅ Document Upload**: Supports PDF and text files
- **✅ Knowledge Base**: In-memory storage with intelligent chunking
- **✅ Question Answering**: Context-aware responses based on uploaded documents
- **✅ Fallback Mode**: Works even without OpenAI API key
- **✅ No Docker Required**: Runs independently

## 🔧 Configuration

### Required Environment Variables (in `.env`):
```bash
# OpenAI API Key (for best AI responses)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# RAGFlow API Key (optional, for future RAGFlow integration)
RAGFLOW_API_KEY=ragflow-NjMmE2YzhlNTQ2ZDExZjBiNzNhZWE3MT
```

## 📡 API Endpoints

### Health Check
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Upload Document
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/upload
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Body: pdf=@your_document.pdf
```

### Ask Question
```bash
POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/ask
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {"question": "Your question here"}
```

### Check Status
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/status
```

## 🧪 Testing

### 1. Start the application:
```bash
node index.js
```

### 2. Test health:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### 3. Upload a document:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/upload -F "pdf=@your_document.pdf"
```

### 4. Ask a question:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/knowledge/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What does the document say about customer service?"}'
```

## 🎯 Current Capabilities

- **Document Processing**: Automatically chunks documents into searchable pieces
- **Intelligent Search**: Finds relevant content based on question keywords
- **AI Responses**: Uses OpenAI to generate contextual answers
- **Fallback Mode**: Provides basic responses when OpenAI is unavailable
- **File Support**: PDF and text files
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **RAGFlow Integration**: When Docker issues are resolved
- **Ollama Integration**: For local LLM support
- **Database Storage**: Persistent knowledge base
- **Vector Search**: More sophisticated document retrieval
- **Multi-language Support**: Internationalization

## 🐛 Known Issues

- **Docker/RAGFlow**: Currently disabled due to Docker performance issues
- **Ollama**: Connection issues on macOS
- **Session Management**: Basic session handling (can be improved)
